=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 valid_nif

Validates Portuguese NIF's.

Returns a true value if the validation succeeds, a false one otherwise.

Currently, validation is done only by the control digit, as follows:

 1) NIF is matched with /^\d{9}$/ (nine consecutive digits with nothing more)
 2) Control digit (last one, the ninth) is removed and store
 3) First digit is multiplied by 9, second by 8, third by 7, fourth by 6, fifth
    by 5, sixth by 4, seventh by 3, eighth by 2
 4) All the results of the multiplication are summed
 5) Modulo of the sum by 11 is found
 6) Complement of the sum by 11 is found
 7) Control digit is compared to said complement

Example for NIF 136695973:

 1) NIF is matched agains /^\d{9}$/, test passes
 2) Control digit is 3 (last digit)
 3) Multiplication: 1*9, 3*8, 6*7, 6*6, 9*5, 5*4, 9*3, 7*2
 4) Sum: 217
 5) 217 % 11 = 8
 6) 11 - 8 = 3
 7) 3 == 3, test passes

When the complement (the result of step 6) is greater than 9, the
number is assumed to be 0.
